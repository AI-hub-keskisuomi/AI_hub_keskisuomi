# Validation of synthetic images using clustering methods

Results of the validation of the synthetic x-ray images using clustering
methods.

## Objectives

 - Analyze the synthetic images by extracting the feature vectors with
 a convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet
 - Cluster the features together with feature vectors extracted from
 real x-ray images to find out
